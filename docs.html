             They were there brfore you were evrn born . Human embryos in the womb develop according to a blueprint that's the same for male abd females.Eventually , the embryos begin to take on features specific to their sex , but not until after they have already developed nipples.Later,in life,chemicals called hormons trigger changes in females so that they can nurse their young .Male don't have those hormons , so they are stuck with nipples that are nothing mor ethan chest accessories .Other than a few exceptions , most mammals have nipples.Nipples don't cause any harm , which is probably why evolution hasn't given them ol' heave-ho.
